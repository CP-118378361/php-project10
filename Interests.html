        <p>
        I began gymnastics at the age of 4 after an accident I had in Lanzarote. The accident led to me fracturing my skull, as a result after I fully recovered my parents thought my balance wasn't very good so decided gymnastics may help.
        I fell in love with the sport straight away and it became a part of life and still is today. I competed for the very 1st time in Level 2 at the age of 7 and came 1st on vault this meant that I had qualified for National finals which were on twice a year.I ended up placing 3rd which was a huge achievement. This was the begin of my success in the sport.I made it all the way from Level 2 to Level 9 and even managed to skip one or two on the way.
        Each year I kept qualifying for Nationals and nearly each time i was coming home with a medal. As I got older and improved I trained more and more hours each week little 4 year old me started off training 1 hour a week and at the age of 14 I was training between 20-25 hours a week. One of my favourite memories was being on my clubs intermediate team for national team finals which was held in my own club. For a national event to be held in my club was a huge deal as they were always on in Dublin. My club had never placed in this competion before but my team and I changes this we came 2nd just 0.60 away from coming 1st!
        I decided to give up training as an elite gymnast at the age of 15 due to the amount of commitment it was and because I was studying for my Junior Cert. Instead of just leaving everything behind when I gave up I was asked if I had any interest in coaching and that was the beginning of my next path in gymnastics. Still today I'm coaching and just last year I qualified as a national judge. It was weird when I went back to National Finals as this time I was the one sitting behind the table and not competing.
